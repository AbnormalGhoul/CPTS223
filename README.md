# Question 1: Linked List advantage/disadvantage
Advantage: Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of commands, especially at the beginning or middle of the list, which is useful when commands are frequently added or removed during gameplay.
Disadvantage: Traversing the linked list to find specific commands can be slow due to the lack of direct indexing, making operations like searching less efficient.

# Question 2: Array advantage/disadvantage
Advantage: Arrays provide constant-time access to user profiles by index, making it efficient to retrieve and update player data during load or save operations.
Disadvantage: Arrays have a fixed size or require resizing, which can be inefficient if the number of user profiles grows unpredictably.
